# `tropical-scaffold`

CLI for quickly scaffolding [Tropical](https://tropical.js.org) pages and components.

Probably not very useful if you're not working on a Tropical project as it depends on this project structure:

```
src/
  pages/
  components/
package.json
```

## Usage

```bash
tropical-scaffold --type=page path/to/my-new-page
tropical-scaffold --type=component MyNewComponent
```
